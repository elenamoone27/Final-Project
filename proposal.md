Title: Ufos and Stars
Repository: https://github.com/elenamoone27/Final-Project.git
Description: I want to create a video of stars twinkling in the night sky and a ufo coming into view and shooting a beam of light then disappearing off the screen
Features: There will be white dots that represent stars and they will twinkle. My UFO will be created out of different shapes and will preferably rotate. For the stars i may have to use the random function and for the twinkling effect i will need to change the opacity in increments. For the ufo, i will need to draw different elipses and draw a polygon for the beam
Challenges: I will need to do research on how to make a rotating shape and figure out how to draw the ufo in the way that I envisioned it. My goal is to make the video have an aesthetic appeal and I plan to achieve that with the colors
Outcomes: 
a. Ideal Outcome: I hope to achieve an aesthetic look for my video, as well as create a dreamy like effect with the stars and make the ufo as accurate to my vision as possible
b. Minimal Viable Outcome: I plan on making the stars twinkle for certain. Even if I can't make the ufo rotate, I want it to still fly into the frame and shoot the beam of light. It's okay if i can't acieve the aesthetic image I want. As long as the function works, that's what I would like to achieve at the least.
Milestones: 
1. First week: I plan on completing the stars and adding the twinkling effect
2. Second week: I will create the ufo and make it move into the frame
3. Third week: The ufo will shoot the beam of light
4. Fourth week: Any color effects will be added as well as touch ups
