# UFOs and Stars

**Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/elenamoone27/Final-Project.git)

**Description:**  
I want to create a video of stars twinkling in the night sky, with a UFO coming into view, shooting a beam of light, and then disappearing off the screen.

**Features:**  
- **Stars:** White dots that represent stars will twinkle. I may use the random function for star placement and adjust opacity for the twinkling effect.
- **UFO:** Created from different shapes and will preferably rotate. Iâ€™ll draw ellipses for the UFO and a polygon for the beam of light.

**Challenges:**  
- Research how to make a rotating shape and figure out the design for the UFO.
- Aim to give the video an aesthetic appeal through colors and a dreamy effect.

**Outcomes:**  
- **Ideal Outcome:** Aesthetically pleasing video with a dreamy star effect and a UFO true to my vision.
- **Minimum Viable Outcome:** Stars twinkle, and the UFO flies into the frame and shoots a beam, even without rotation or full aesthetic appeal.

**Milestones:**  
1. **Week 1:** Complete stars and add the twinkling effect.
2. **Week 2:** Create the UFO and make it move into the frame.
3. **Week 3:** UFO shoots the beam of light.
4. **Week 4:** Add color effects and any final touch-ups.
